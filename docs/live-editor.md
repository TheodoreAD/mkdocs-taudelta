# Live Editor

## What this is

### Philosophy

The point of `MkDocs Tau Delta` is to make `Markdown` the language of choice
among engineers writing documentation.

An additional goal is to address a larger group of users
beyond the ones creating documentation.
If meeting minutes, roadmaps, speeches, presentation notes could be created
on-the-fly and saved to a site where stakeholders can read and contribute
to the documents easily, then senior engineers, team leads and
project/product/department managers would become part of the target audience,
leading to significantly increased product proliferation.

Success depends on at least four factors:

- richness of features
- quality, both functionally and aesthetically
- ease of setup
- ease of use

This section is an attempt to improve the ease of use through the cunning use
of a free live editor, which is naturally not a part of the project.

### Requirements

The ideal set of features is:

- edit Markdown documents in a `free`, `ad-free`, `clutter-free` split-screen editor and preview web app
- open Markdown documents directly from an MkDocs Tau Delta enabled repository
- save Markdown documents directly to an MkDocs Tau Delta enabled repository
- continuously synchronize with the persistent document source while editing

This would enable the use of Markdown for note-taking as well as for documentation.
